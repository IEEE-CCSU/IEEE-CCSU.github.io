## Go Baby Go

### Mission Statement
* “[Go Baby Go](https://www.yourcpf.org/cpproduct/go-baby-go-the-ultimate-toy-hack/),” is a program that provides modified, ride-on cars to young children with disabilities so they can move around independently.

### Current Efforts
* We are currently working on wiring the car. This semester is having a heavy focus on getting the car operating and ready to donate to the organization
